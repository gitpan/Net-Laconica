NAME
    Net::Laconica - Perl extension for fetching from, and sending
    notices/messages to Laconica instances

VERSION
    Version 0.08

SYNOPSIS
        use Net::Laconica;

        my $identi = Net::Laconica->new(
            uri      => 'http://identi.ca/',
            username => 'alanhaggai',
            password => 'topsecret'
        );

        print map { $_, "\n" } $identi->fetch;

DESCRIPTION
    This module is designed to support "fetch"ing and "send"ing messages to
    Laconica instances.

METHODS
    The implemented methods are:

    "new"
        Returns a blessed hash reference object. This method accepts a hash
        reference with "uri", "username" and "password" as keys. "uri" and
        "username" are required, whereas "password" is optional.

        "uri"
            Holds the URI to the particular Laconica instance to which the
            object is to be bound.

            Example:

                uri => 'http://identi.ca'  # Presence or absence of a trailing slash in the URI does not matter

        "username"
            Username for the Laconica instance.

            Example:

                username => 'alanhaggai'

        "password"
            Password for the Laconica instance.

            Password is required only if you wish to "send" messages.

            Example:

                my $identi = Net::Laconica->new(
                    uri      => 'http://identi.ca/',
                    username => 'alanhaggai',
                    password => 'topsecret'
                );

            Or:

                my $identi = Net::Laconica->new(
                    uri      => 'http://identi.ca/',
                    username => 'alanhaggai',
                    password => 'topsecret'
                );

    "fetch"
        Returns an array of recent messages.

        Default number of recent messages returned is 10. The value can be
        changed by passing the value as an argument to the method. Maximum
        limit for the value is 20.

        Example:

            my @messages = $laconica->fetch;  # Fetches the top 10 messages
                                              # (If there exists less than 10 messages,
                                              # they are all returned)

        Or:

            my @messages = $laconica->fetch(3);  # Fetches the top 3 messages

    "send"
        Sends a message.

        Returns 0 if an error occurs.

        Example:

            if( $laconica->send('Hello world') ) {
                print 'Message sent successfully.';
            }
